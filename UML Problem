A record company needs a system in which they can keep track of their artists, bands,
albums and songs.
The system needs to be able to track copyrights through time on a song, album and band
level, as well as to know a band’s formation at a given time.
For complexity’s sake, we’ll assume that:
● An album can only belong to one band
● A song can only belong to one album
● An artist cannot join a band after they leave it.
